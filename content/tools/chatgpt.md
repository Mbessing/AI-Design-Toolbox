ChatGPT is a service by OpenAI, and in it's own words:

> ChatGPT is an AI-based conversational agent developed by OpenAI. It belongs to the family of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models, specifically GPT-3.5 in its latest version. ChatGPT is designed to engage in natural language conversations with users, offering responses and generating text based on the input it receives.
>
> Using a vast amount of text data from the internet, ChatGPT has been trained to understand and generate human-like text across a wide range of topics and contexts. It can provide information, answer questions, hold conversations, and even generate creative content like stories or poems.
>
> The primary goal of ChatGPT is to assist users in various tasks, provide information, entertain, and engage in natural language interactions, making it a versatile tool for a variety of applications, from customer service to language learning and beyond. [1]

ChatGPT is available at [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/). There is a
free version based on currently version 3.5. Version 4.0, including a number of additional
language models, are available as a subscription service.

DTU gives access for students and employees to a somewhat similar language model from Microsoft, which you can find at
