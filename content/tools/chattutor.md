ChatTutor is a DTU-based startup which enable students to get help from an AI-tutor or from teaching assistant (TA).
Teachers upload the course material on ChatTutor (slides, notes, exercises) and ChatTutor will then base it's answers
on the course material and refer students to the relevant sections.

Questions ChatTutor cannot answer can be escelated to teaching assistents, and the answers provided by ChatTutor will then
be available to the entire class. This allows for a better utilization of our existing TA resources.

ChatTutor is currently used as a pilot study on a course with 120 students and if you are interested, you can contact us
for a test in your course.
