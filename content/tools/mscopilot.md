DTU gives access for students and employees to a somewhat similar language model from Microsoft, which you can find at 
[https://copilot.microsoft.com/](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

The version made available is based on ChatGPT4 Turbo (as of April 2024), and offers a protected model that keeps
all searches and answers within DTU's cloud solutions, so that they will not be used to train the AI model.

The full announcement can be found [here](https://www.dtu.dk/english/newsarchive/2024/02/dtu-makes-artificial-intelligence-available-to-students).

In order to access the service, you can go to [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/chat) and log in with your DTU credentials.

Note that the service also provides access to DALL-E, so you can prompt the service to generate images.
