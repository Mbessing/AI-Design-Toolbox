DTU gives access for students and employees to a somewhat similar chat tool, based on a large language model, 
from Microsoft, which you can find at 
[https://copilot.microsoft.com/](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

The version made available to DTU students and employees is based on ChatGPT4 Turbo (as of April 2024), 
and offers a protected model that keeps all searches and answers within DTU's cloud solutions, 
so that they will not be used to train the AI model.

The full announcement can be found [here](https://www.dtu.dk/english/newsarchive/2024/02/dtu-makes-artificial-intelligence-available-to-students).

In order to access the service, you can go to [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/chat) and log in with your DTU credentials.

The service also provides access to DALL-E, so you can prompt the service to generate images.

Note, however, that the similarly named "Copilot" assistive technololgies in other Microsoft tools 
(Word, Powerpoint, Outlook, ...) are not included in the toolbox made available to DTU students and employees.

Neither are the similarly named "Copilot" tool found the Microsoft owned GitHub universe; however these may
be available to students and faculty through a general academic version that requires separate registration and 
verification. The license terms will then also be different.
