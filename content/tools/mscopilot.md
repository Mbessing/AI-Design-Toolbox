DTU gives access for students and employees to a somewhat similar chat tool, based on a large language model, 
from Microsoft, which you can find at 
[https://copilot.microsoft.com/](https://copilot.microsoft.com/). It is sometimes referred to as "Copilot for the web".

The version made available to DTU students and employees is based on ChatGPT4 Turbo (as of April 2024), 
and offers a protected model that keeps all searches and answers within DTU's cloud solutions, 
so that they will not be used to train the AI model.

The full announcement can be found [here](https://www.dtu.dk/english/newsarchive/2024/02/dtu-makes-artificial-intelligence-available-to-students). You can also read more on [AI-technolgoies at DTU](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/medarbejder/it-og-telefoni/it-politik-og-retningslinjer/ai-paa-dtu).

In order to access the service, you can go to [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/chat) and log in with your DTU credentials.

You can also use it [from within tghe Edge browser](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/medarbejder/it-og-telefoni/it-politik-og-retningslinjer/ai-paa-dtu/microsoft-ai/copilot-for-web).

To get started prompting, you may also seek inspiration from [this article](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/medarbejder/it-og-telefoni/it-politik-og-retningslinjer/ai-paa-dtu/prompting-hvordan-skriver-du-til-ai).

The service also provides access to DALL-E, so you can prompt the service to generate images.

Note, however, that the similarly named "Copilot 365" assistive technololgies in other Microsoft tools 
(Word, Powerpoint, Outlook, ...) are [not included in the toolbox made available to DTU students and employees](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/medarbejder/it-og-telefoni/it-politik-og-retningslinjer/ai-paa-dtu/microsoft-ai/copilot-365).

Neither are the similarly named ["Copilot" tool](https://education.github.com/experiences/primer_copilot) found in the Microsoft owned GitHub universe; however these may
be available to students and faculty through a general academic version that requires separate registration and 
verification. The license terms will then also be different.
