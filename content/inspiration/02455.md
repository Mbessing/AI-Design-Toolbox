**Rapporteur: Ivana Konvalinka**

**Type of assessment:** Group oral examination and individualized group
report with a page limit. 60% oral exam, 40% report

**Exam duration**: Oral exam: 30 minutes

**Aid**: Presentation slides

**Evaluation:** 7 step scale, external examiner

**General course objectives**

Experimentation in cognitive science is a young field, and many
mysteries remain about human behaviour, perception, and performance.
With the ever-growing amount of human data available, and development of
data science and artificial intelligence, it is a crucial time for
understanding how to collect, handle, and interpret human data.   
  
This course will teach engineering students how to formulate research
questions and testable hypotheses in cognitive science, use them to
design and carry out an appropriate experiment by collecting behavioural
and/or physiological data from human participants, and interpret the
results of their experiments in the context of a wider research question
within cognitive science.   
  
Experiments will be conducted at the CogSys behavioural lab, in the
classroom, or online in groups of 2-3. The course is limited to 50
students. 

**Learning objectives**

A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:

-   Describe ethical considerations when conducting experiments with
    human participants

-   Describe different behavioural (i.e. reaction time, eye-tracking)
    and physiological (i.e. heart rate, HRV) measures in cognitive
    science, and how they can inform human cognition

-   Use AI to zoom into a research field of interest, within the field
    of cognitive science

-   Find, assess, and review relevant literature in the chosen field of
    cognitive science

-   Formulate a research question and testable hypothesis in cognitive
    science

-   Design an experiment in cognitive science to test a given hypothesis

-   Perform an experiment to test the hypothesis by collecting
    behavioural or physiological data from human participants

-   Analyze the experiment by pre-processing the data and applying
    appropriate statistical models

-   Report the results of the experiment, and interpret them in the
    context of a wider research area
