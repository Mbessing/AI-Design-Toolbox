The library has created a guide for 
[referencing when using generative AI](https://www.bibliotek.dtu.dk/en/publishing/reference-management/kunstig-intelligens),
which also includes links to [DTU's code of honour](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/regler/aereskodeks).

That is the official guidance to students and employees regarding good scientific conduct when using AI.

Aligned with the above, the use of AI is addressed in the section on plagiarism found in the
rules for 
[Cheating at exams and other forms of assessment](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/undervisning/regler/regler-for-eksamen/snyd-ved-eksamen-og-anden-bedoemmelse#Hvad).
