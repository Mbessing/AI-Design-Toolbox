Critical thinking is a set of complex cognitive processes, see, e.g.,
the textbook by Moore and Parker for definitions, theory and
analysis[1].

Here we provide a basic list of checkpoints to evaluate academic
products with a specific focus on their external input. The need for
systematic critical thinking is amplified by the advent of generative AI
that allows massive generation of academic-like products.

Potential use cases could be critical (self-)evaluation of student
reports, scientific papers, or peer review reports. We thank the authors
of the *Calling Bullshit* curriculum[2] for inspiration.

**Imagine an academic product such as a student or peer review report.
Consider these points of evaluation:**

-   **Product design / outline**

    -   Is the product’s design appropriate: Are aims and questions
        clearly articulated.

    -   Is the conclusion concise, relevant to the aims and the research
        questions and is the conclusion backed by the claimed results?

    -   Does the product refer to external knowledge sources when
        relevant?

-   **External source examination**

    -   Does a given source exist? Check references to papers, blogs,
        news outlets etc.

    -   Status of a source: Is the source primary/secondary etc. If
        secondary, has the primary source been checked?

    -   Is the given source trustworthy, e.g., peer review status,
        impact measures, possible controversies / predatory behavior,
        retractions etc.?

    -   Does the source contain the claim it is cited for?

    -   Can there be a publication bias in relation to the claim?

-   **Checking claims, reproducibility**

    -   Does the product contain theoretical or empirical claims, or
        does it make reference to such claims?

    -   If theoretical: has a proof been provided, has the proof been
        examined?

    -   If empirical: has the evidence been examined. Causality,
        experimental design, effect size, sample size, use of unbiased
        estimators for test quantities etc.

    -   If empirical: Can experiments be reproduced based on the methods
        description?

    -   If result is graphical / a figure or a table: Is primary data
        available?

    -   If result is graphical / a figure: Do the inferences and
        conclusions find support in the content and captions of the
        figure?

    -   Are visuals and their assumptions examined (e.g., choice of
        axis, log scales etc.)?

-   **Ethical dimensions**

    -   Does the product contain normative statements, such as
        expressions of value?

    -   Value alignment: Are the values expressed consistent with the
        values of the assignment? For example, is a given peer review
        aligned with the peer review guidelines?

    -   Has the product been examined for biases, e.g., ethnicity,
        political, gender, age, etc.?

    -   If sensitive data has been used, has consent been given and is
        the product within the scope of consent?

    -   Is the list of authors complete?

    -   Have potential conflicts of interest been declared?

    -   General motives: Who benefits from the product?

    -   Are broader impact concerns accounted for? Sustainability,
        contribution to power imbalances etc.
