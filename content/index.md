Welcome to the **DRAFT/BETA** DTU AI Info Hub. 

This site is meant to assist you, as a course responsible, when considering the use of 
generative AI (like OpenAI [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3), 
Microsoft [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), etc) in your course(s) at DTU.

# Getting Started

To help you get started, a number of flows have been designed to provide inspiration and
links to relevant material. Just click the following links if you consider how generative AI may impact 
the [Learning Objectives]({{< ref "#learning-objectives" >}}),
the [Course Content and Teaching]({{< ref "#course-content-and-teaching" >}}),
or the [Evaluation]({{< ref "#evaluation" >}}).

# Site Overview

In addtion to the flows, this site is organised around the following sections that you can also browse directly:

* [Checklists](checklists) -- A number of checklist to help you organise or plan your course
* [Inspiration](inspiration) -- Examples from other courses and activities at DTU
* [News](news) -- News from DTU highly relevant for using generative AI at DTU
* [FAQ](faq) -- Frequently Asked Questions
* [Rules](rules) -- Links to relevant rules and guidelines
* [Tools](tools) -- An overview of (perhaps) relevant tools to get you started

# Course Content and Teaching

Generative AI could potentially improve teaching and learning, help to better reach learning objectives or 
improve the evaluation of your course.

Considering the level of engagement with generative AI in DTU courses, multiple strategies may be  envisioned:

* **“No-no” courses** that teach students basic personal competences
  with limited use of AI during the course and no use of AI in exams,
  e.g., basic math, programming etc.

* **AI-adapted courses** where students are encouraged in learning
  objectives to use AI, yet students are _partially_ prohibited from
  using AI in exams. An example is 02450 Introduction to machine learning,
  where the use of tools is tested in project reports, while a final
  personal assessment is carried out as a multiple-choice exam without
  AI tools.

* **AI first courses**, i.e., courses that encourage the use of AI in
  all phases of the course, during learning and in the exams/evaluation.

There is a possibility that the two latter strategies may harvest an AI bonus 
and engage students at more complex scientific levels than in pre-AI courses.

Here is a flow you may use to get started considering how to use generative AI in your course:

* First, **list** the current learning objectives.
* For each, **describe** the desired outcome, as detailed and concretely as possible.
* Consider **how generative ai will influence** these outcomes, listing the pros and cons.
* **decide** (yes/no) whether AI should be used to support these outcomes, weighing the pros and cons.
* For areas where generative AI will be used, describe in as much detail as relevant **how** generative AI can be USED to SUPPORT the outcomes.
* Consider **what needs to happen** to make this work
* Consider how this will **impact the [evaluation/exam]({{< ref "#evaluation" >}})**
* Consider how this will **impact the [learning objectives]({{< ref "#learning-objectives" >}})**
* Define measureable **criteria for successful implementation**
* **evaluate and adjust** after the course has run

For a template and example look at [AI in 41031 Industrial Design](/inspiration/AI_Course_Implementation_Planner_V1.pdf) 
([.xls](/inspiration/AI_Course_Implementation_Planner_V1.xls) format).

You can decide not to include generative AI tools or methods in your course, but students may nevertheless 
wish to, or be inspired from elsewhere, to do so. You would then instead have to guide students on acceptable use (if any).

# Evaluation

Generative AI will impact the evalution of many courses. 

Consider:

* What will be the difference between a student using generative AI and one that doesn't?
* Consider to which degree generative AI is part of your course:
  *
  *
  *
* If students are NOT allowed to use generative AI for preparing the evaluation material (project report) or exam:
  * Will the exam then have to be pen and paper only?
    * If so, how will the students be able to train 
  * Will other tools and course material (fact sheets, course material) be allowed, and if so, 
    how will it be provided?
* If students ARE allowed to use generative AI for preparing the evaluation material (project report) or exam:
  * Can students be treated equally or are some
